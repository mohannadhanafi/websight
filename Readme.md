# Car Management App

This is a simple car management app built with React. It allows users to view and search for car data fetched from a JSON server.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- Yarn package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-management-app.git`

2. Change to the project directory:
`cd car-management-app`

3. Install the dependencies using Yarn:
`yarn install`

### Starting the Development Server
To start the development server and run the app locally, use the following command:

`yarn dev`

This will launch the app in your default browser at http://localhost:3000. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger a hot reload.

### Starting the JSON Server
The app relies on a JSON server to fetch car data. To start the JSON server, use the following command:

`yarn run json-server`

The JSON server will be available at http://localhost:3001. The app will make API requests to this server to fetch the car data.
